    <p style="text-align: center;font-family: cursive;">While coding has become more popular nowadays, you might have questioned why coding is important? It important because coding encourages you to use logic
      and algorithms to create a program. When facing a new challenge, you need to follow a logical approach to solve the issue. Therefore, this is an exercise for your brain to train up
      your logical ability. Logical thinking is not only about solving algorithms but also beneficial to your personal and professional life. Coding teaches you how to think. During the
      coding process, you need to give a solution to an issue that involves intensive problem-solving skills. It trains your brain to think deeply, identify the troubles, and break things
      up, then put the pieces together with a solution. These kinds of troubleshooting skills help you become a smarter person personally and professionally and see a situation from a
      completely new perspective.Someone might think coding is boring with standard formulas, but it can be fun and creative. There wont be the same problems to be resolved every time,
      you will overcome different kinds of challenges that require new solutions. While working on coding projects, you can make use of your creativity to provide a tailored solution to
      an issue and your innovative solution might somehow change the world.</p>

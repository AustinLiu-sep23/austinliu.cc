     <p style="text-align: center;width: 865px;margin: auto;">David's Pizza Store was founded in 1999 and lorem ipsum is simply dummy text of printing and typesetting industy. Lorem ipsum has been the industry dummy text ever since
        the 1500, when the unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make type specimen book. It has survived not only 5 centuries, but also the leap into electronic
        typesetting , remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset street containing Lorem ipsum passages, and more recently with
        desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including verions of Lorem Ipsum. Order now!
